.Nm geoconv
.Nd CSV geolocation to binary conversion tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers the user a way to convert a CSV geolocation database
for IPv4 and IPv6 into a binary file, which can be loaded using the
.Xr peak_locate 3
API.
.Pp
All input files are read and inserted into an internal structure
to check their integrity, before they are written out into a sorted
binary file.
A file header makes sure that a different revision of
.Nm
cannot be mixed in operation due to changes in the
.Xr peak_locate 3
ABI.
.Pp
The output file
.Pa <file>.bin
is written after a successful conversion.
.Pp
The CSV input data understood by this utility can be found at
.Lk http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite
