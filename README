libpeak -- network-related library glue
=======================================

This library consists of several modules and generic base headers
designed around the daily needs of network-related userland tools.
Currently, the available modules are:

peak_load:	PCAP/ERF file reader
peak_track:	simple flow tracker

This code builds fine on MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux (Ubuntu).
You break it, you fix it.

Building the code:

 # make

Running the tests:

 # cd regress && make

Having fun:

 # priceless ;)
