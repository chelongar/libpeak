libpeak -- network-related library glue
=======================================

This library consists of several modules and generic base headers
designed around the daily needs of network packet-related userland
tools written in C.  Currently, the available modules are:

peak_load:	PCAP/ERF file reader
peak_tcp:	shallow TCP engine
peak_track:	simple flow tracker
peak_udp:	shallow UDP engine

There's also a bunch of arch-independent base headers, which offer
simple memory pools, runtime allocation wrappers, network address
mapping, simple hashes, output macros, spinlock/barrier wrappers,
and so forth.

A good introduction to the code would be its man pages.  The first of
them being peek(1).

Licensing and contributions
===========================

The library has been developed by Packetwerk and is released under the
ISC license (see COPYING for details).  Its main contributors are:

Franco Fichtner <franco@lastsummer.de>

form of supplying trace files or hard to come by documentation to help
maintain a reliable and free library.

Building and running the code
=============================

This code builds fine on MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux (Ubuntu).
You break it, you fix it.

Building the code:

 # make

Running the tests:

 # cd regress && make

Having fun:

 # priceless ;)
