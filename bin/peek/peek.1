.Sh NAME
.Nm peek
.Nd trace file tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl AafNnt
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers the user a way to run application layer analysis on
network capture (trace) files in PCAP or ERF format.
The output of the utility is one line per packet and can be customised
using the command line options.
The default is
.Sq Fl tfNnsda .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl A" -offset indent
.It Fl A
Display the application payload length.
.It Fl a
Display the detected application.
See
.Xr peak_li 3
for more details.
.It Fl d
Display the destination address and port number (if available).
.It Fl f
Display the unique flow number.
See
.Xr peak_track 3
for more details.
.It Fl N
Display the IP length.
.It Fl n
Display the IP type.
.It Fl s
Display the source address and port number (if available).
.It Fl t
Display the timestamp.
.El
.Pp
The supplied file is loaded via the
.Xr peak_load 3
module.
All packets of the file are supplied to the main thread, which does
simple packet header parsing (see
.Xr peak_packet 3
for more details) to extract all needed information to construct the
flow tuple (network addresses, ports, and transport protocol).
Next, this flow tuple is converted into a unique storage slot in
.Xr peak_track 3 .
Finally, the flow's application layer protocol is detected using the
.Xr peak_li 3
API and remembered for all subsequent packets of the same flow.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa scripts/peek_to_csv.py" -compact
.It Pa scripts/peek_to_csv.py
A Python script converting
.Nm
output to CSV.
It is used mainly for preparing the output for statistical analysis
in external tools.

.Sh CAVEATS
There is no IP defragmentation or TCP reordering available, which may
cause unreliable output for application layer magic.
