.Dt PEAK_LOAD 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm peak_load_exit ,
.Nm peak_load_init ,
.Nm peak_load_packet
.Nd open and read a trace file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In peak.h
.Ft void
.Fn peak_load_exit "stuct peak_load *self"
.Ft struct peak_load *
.Fn peak_load_init "const char *file"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn peak_load_packet "struct peak_load *self"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm peak_load
API provides a mechanism to open network captures (trace files).
Each packet is being provided sequentially.
The library can automatically detect the file format,
or will fall back to ERF mode.
However, input given via
.Xr stdin 4
is always considered an ERF file.
.Pp
Specifications have been taken from
.Lk http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat/
for the PCAP file structure, from
.Lk http://www.winpcap.org/ntar/draft/PCAP-DumpFileFormat.html
for the PCAPNG file structure, as well as from
.Lk http://wiki.wireshark.org/ERF
for the ERF file structure.
.Pp
All formats are viable, but PCAP is considered the most compatible.
And
.Xr pcap 3
is not just a format \(em it is also a full packet capture and
injection engine.
However, ERF allows for marking packets with their respective capture
interface, while PCAP always only listens on one interface.
Another advantage of ERF is that it doesn't implement a global file
header, which allows files to be concatenated in the following way:
.Pp
.Dl $ cat file1.erf file2.erf > merged.erf
.Pp
The
.Nm peak_load
API needs to be initialised with
.Fn peak_load_init
before it can be used.
The function returns a
.Vt struct peak_load *
reference, which is an argument for all other API calls.
.Pp
In order to load the next available packet, an application needs to call
.Fn peak_load_packet .
The packet resides in the
.Vt struct peak_load *
for examination, until
.Fn peak_load_packet
is called again.
Upon successful completion
.Fn peak_load_packet
returns the size of the next packet.
Otherwise, 0 is returned.
.Pp
A call to
.Fn peak_load_exit
releases the reference to
.Vt struct peak_load *
and closes the trace file.
