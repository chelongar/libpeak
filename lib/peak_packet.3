.Nd packet preprocessing
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm peak_packet
API preprocesses a given packet and prepares its associated structure
for general use.
It will scan up until the transport layer and ensure the packet's
validity.
It can be considered a legacy packet filter (IPv4/v6, TCP, UDP, ICMP).
.Pp
In order to process a packet, the caller needs to invoke
.Fn peak_packet_next ,
with
.Va buf ,
.Va len ,
and
.Va type
describing the location, size, and link type of the packet.
If you may want to invoke the packet parsing only, the
.Fn PACKET_LINK
macro will do the link layer parsing, but does not invoke any associated
subsystem.
For now, the only link layer types known to
.Nm peak_packet
are
.Dv LINKTYPE_ETHERNET
and
.Dv LINTYPE_LINUX_SLL .
.Fn peak_packet_next
returns zero if the packet was parsed successfully.
Otherwise, non-zero is returned to advise the caller to drop the
packet.
