.Sh NAME
.Nm peek
.Nd trace file tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers the user a way to run application layer analysis on
network capture (trace) files in PCAP or ERF format.
The output of the utility is one line per packet with general information,
flow id, and matching application name.
.Pp
The supplied file is loaded via the
.Xr peak_load 3
module.
All packets of the file are supplied to the main thread, which does
simple packet header parsing to extract all needed information to
build the flow tuple.
Next, this flow tuple is converted into a unique storage slot in
.Xr peak_track 3 .
.Pp
For now, the application layer analysis parts are missing.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and !0 if an error occured.
.Sh CAVEATS
There is no IP defragmentation or TCP reordering available, which may
cause unreliable output for application layer magic.
