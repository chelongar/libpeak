libpeak -- network-related library glue
=======================================

This library consists of several modules and generic base headers
designed around the daily needs of network packet-related userland
tools written in C.  Currently, the available modules are:

peak_jar:	context-based circular buffer
peak_li:	lightweight inspection (DPI)
peak_load:	PCAP/PCAPNG/ERF/NETMON file reader
peak_netmap:	simplified netmap(4) bindings
peak_packet:	packet preprocessor
peak_store:	PCAP file writer
peak_stream:	stream memory allocator
peak_string:	full-text string search
peak_tcp:	shallow TCP engine
peak_track:	rudimentary flow tracker
peak_udp:	shallow UDP engine

There's also a bunch of arch-independent base headers, which offer
simple memory pools, runtime allocation wrappers, network address
mapping, some hashes, output macros, spinlock/barrier wrappers,
and so forth.

A good introduction to the code would be its man pages.  The first of
them being peek(1).

Licensing and contributions
===========================

The library has been developed by Packetwerk and is released under the
ISC license (see COPYING for details).

Feel free to fork or contribute back.  To do so, use GitHub or send
your patches to us via email.  Contributions can also be made in the
form of supplying trace files or hard to come by documentation to help
maintain a reliable and free library.

Building and running the code
=============================

The code builds fine on MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and Linux
(Ubuntu with pmake installed).  You break it, you fix it.

Building the code:

    make

Running the tests:

    cd regress && make
